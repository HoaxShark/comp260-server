## To swap between local testing and online play with the DO server change local_host in __main__.py to true for using a local server and false for the DO server.

## A build of the client is avaliable at /Client Build/dist/__main__/__main__.exe this build is set for the DO server only

## Server and client are using python 3.6

# The Best MUD

To help with the creation of this client server MUD I have created some useful design documents to steer the way I create the client and server. All images can also be found in the Design Documents folder.

# World Design
I also made a map to help myself with room creation and placement in the world. Cureently only a few of the church rooms are in use.  
There is an editable paint.net version of this image which is bigger and has room indexing on it in the Design Documents folder.
